## Description
This is a game project from Udacity's FrontEnd Web Development nanodegree, a scholarship course from Google. 

## Installation
Play online [here](https://irinabgdn.github.io/fend-arcade-game/) or install to your website by adding the files and linking the scripts to your HTML.

## Instructions
Use your arrow keys to control direction so you reach water while saving yourself from the bugs.

You get 6 lives, losing all of them means you lose. 
If you reach level 10 you win the game!
But be careful, the bugs are multiplying themselves.
